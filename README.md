# NLP-EHR

Under Professor Dragomir Radev, I researched applications of NLP with Electronic Health Records. The lab webpages are https://github.com/Yale-LILY and https://yale-lily.github.io/. Because our repository for the EHR project is private, I've only attached our survey paper, titled "Neural Natural Language Processing for Unstructured Data in Electronic Health Records: A Review."
