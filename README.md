# NLP-EHR

Under Professor Dragomir Radev, I researched applications of NLP with Electronic Health Records. More information about the LILY lab can be found at https://github.com/Yale-LILY (code) and https://yale-lily.github.io/ (website). Because our repository for the EHR project is private, I've only attached our survey paper, titled "Neural Natural Language Processing for Unstructured Data in Electronic Health Records: A Review."
